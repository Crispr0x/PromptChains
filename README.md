# ChatGPT Queue Prompts - used for bulk prompting in [ChatGPT Queue](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-queue/iabnajjakkfbclflgaghociafnjclbem?hl=en&authuser=0)

ChatGPT Queue Prompts is a collection of prompt chains designed to enhance interactions with large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT with the use of ChatGPT Queue. These prompt chains help build context for the AI before performing specific tasks. [Which improves performance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08387)

## What are Prompt Chains?

Prompt chains are sequences of prompts for LLMs that help build context for the AI before having it perform a task. In this project, prompt chains are represented as strings with individual prompts separated by tildes (`~`). They should be copy and pastable into ChatGPT Queue bulk prompting

For example: `"prompt1~prompt2~prompt3"`

## Usage

**To use a prompt chain, simply copy the entire chain and paste it into the ChatGPT Queue extension**. The AI will process each prompt in sequence, building context before tackling the final task.

## Example Prompt Chains

### Example 1: AI Company Research

This prompt chain helps research publicly traded companies benefiting from the rise of AI:

```
Using your web search capabilities, I want you to search the web for the latest information on publicly traded companies that are currently benefiting from the rise of AI. Include URL columns where I can learn more about each company, their competitive advantages, and any analyst ratings. Return this back in a table inline. We will research in batches of 10, when I say "More" you find 10 more. Keep the information brief and all within the inline table. Example: | Company Name | Stock Symbol | Competitive Advantages | Analyst Ratings | URL | |--------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------| | Company A | ABC | Leading AI technology, strong R&D | Strong Buy | Link | | Company B | XYZ | Dominant in AI software, extensive patents| Moderate Buy | Link | Please provide the latest information available. ~More ~ More ~ More
```

### Example 2: AI SaaS Market Analysis

This prompt chain guides the creation of a comprehensive market analysis report for the AI SaaS market:

```
Let's build a comprehensive Market Analysis Report for the AI SaaS market. The report should contain, Market Overview Market Dynamics Market Segmentation Competitive Landscape Consumer Analysis Market Size and Forecast SWOT Analysis Regulatory Environment Technological Advancements Strategic Recommendations Start by outputting the table of contents for our document. When I say "next". Start on the first section, and so on and so forth. Using your search capabilities to get real time information.~next~next~next
```

### Example 3: Writing a Fantasy Book

This prompt chain assists in creating a structured outline and chapters for a fantasy book:

```

```
