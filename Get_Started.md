# Getting Started with ChatGPT Queue

## Introduction

ChatGPT Queue is a powerful tool that enhances your interaction with ChatGPT by allowing you to queue messages and use bulk prompting. This guide will help you understand the main features and how to use them effectively.

Recent research from the University of Washington has shown that providing AI models with additional context from their own dataset leads to improved performance on various reasoning tasks. This concept, known as "generated knowledge prompting," is detailed in their paper [available here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08387). ChatGPT Queue leverages this insight by enabling you to efficiently queue multiple prompts, allowing for more comprehensive and context-rich interactions with the AI.

## Main Features

1. **Manual Queueing**

   - Quickly queue up the next message in the middle of a chat.

2. **Bulk Prompting**
   - Pass in a whole workflow with a Prompt Chain.

## How to Use

### Manual Queueing

1. Start a conversation with ChatGPT
2. While ChatGPT is responding, continue typing your next prompt
3. Press "Enter" to add the prompt to the queue
4. The queue UI will appear once you start queueing messages
5. If you're in the middle of typing a prompt, the extension will wait until you queue it or clear the input field before sending the next prompt

### Bulk Prompting

1. Prepare a Prompt Chain (series of prompts separated by ~)
2. Copy the entire Prompt Chain
3. Paste it into the ChatGPT Queue extension
4. The extension will automatically build a queue with these prompts
